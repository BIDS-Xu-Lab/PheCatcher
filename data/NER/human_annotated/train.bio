Our	O
study	O
has	O
several	O
potential	O
limitations	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
used	O
a	O
more	O
conservative	O
method	O
to	O
select	O
subjects	O
who	O
had	O
depression	O
and	O
/	O
or	O
AD	O
by	O
diagnosis	O
and	O
medication	O
instead	O
of	O
by	O
questionnaire	O
,	O
some	O
subjects	O
with	O
depression	O
or	O
AD	O
diagnosis	O
/	O
medication	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
excluded	O
due	O
to	O
a	O
lack	O
of	O
information	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
NHI	O
in	O
Taiwan	O
is	O
a	O
compulsory	O
insurance	O
covering	O
99	O
%	O
of	O
the	O
total	O
population	O
of	O
Taiwan	O
,	O
we	O
believe	O
that	O
unidentified	O
cases	O
of	O
elderly	O
patients	O
with	O
both	O
diseases	O
are	O
rare	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
treatment	O
of	O
both	O
depression	O
and	O
AD	O
in	O
Taiwan	O
is	O
expensive	O
,	O
the	O
NHI	O
bureau	O
requests	O
that	O
physicians	O
go	O
through	O
complex	O
processes	O
to	O
confirm	O
the	O
incidence	O
of	O
both	O
diseases	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
depression	O
on	O
AD	O
might	O
be	O
underestimated	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
high	O
stringency	O
in	O
selecting	O
subjects	O
.	O

Since	O
over	O
99	O
%	O
of	O
total	O
population	O
is	O
insured	O
by	O
the	O
NHI	O
,	O
the	O
impact	O
of	O
uninsured	O
subjects	O
on	O
our	O
findings	O
should	O
be	O
minimal	O
.	O

Thirdly	O
,	O
the	O
data	O
source	O
of	O
this	O
study	O
was	O
the	O
NHIRD	O
which	O
lacked	O
relevant	O
clinical	O
variables	O
such	O
as	O
laboratory	O
data	O
and	O
pathology	O
findings	O
.	O

A	O
misclassification	O
bias	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
present	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
sex	O
effect	O
in	O
this	O
study	O
was	O
viewed	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
confounding	O
factors	O
when	O
explore	O
the	O
association	O
between	O
major	O
depressive	O
disorder	O
and	O
the	O
later	O
development	O
of	O
AD	O
,	O
further	O
studies	O
should	O
be	O
conducted	O
to	O
analyses	O
the	O
potential	O
for	O
condition	O
-	O
related	O
sex	O
difference	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
considered	O
that	O
such	O
difference	O
might	O
underscore	O
important	O
implications	O
for	O
the	O
understanding	O
of	O
the	O
overall	O
pathogenesis	O
of	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
AD	O
among	O
the	O
old	O
major	O
depressive	O
patients	O
.	O

In	O
conclusion	O
,	O
the	O
onset	O
of	O
AD	O
is	O
found	O
in	O
approximately	O
one	O
-	O
third	O
of	O
the	O
elderly	O
patients	O
with	O
AD	O
also	O
suffering	O
from	O
depression	O
.	O

Symptoms	O
related	O
to	O
cognitive	O
functions	O
are	O
unclear	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
accurate	O
diagnosis	O
relies	O
on	O
the	O
reliability	O
of	O
information	O
provided	O
by	O
families	O
or	O
care	O
-	O
givers	O
.	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
some	O
patients’	O
families	O
or	O
care	O
-	O
givers	O
also	O
suffer	O
from	O
depression	O
or	O
other	O
emotional	O
problems	O
while	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
patients	O
.	O

This	O
may	O
influence	O
the	O
information	O
provided	O

Therefore	O
,	O
hospitalization	O
often	O
proves	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
more	O
reliable	O
method	O
of	O
diagnosis	O
.	O

Thus	O

be	O
devised	O
for	O
geriatric	O
patients	O
with	O
