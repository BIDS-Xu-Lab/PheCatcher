We used the @coding_system$ classification system to identify the @phenotype$ among adult MEPS study participants.	0
We operationally defined a @phenotype$ as any oral prescription that had a @coding_system$ code that fit within the classification of “narcotic analgesic” or “narcotic analgesic combination;” the former category captured pure agonists like oxycodone and the later captured combination drugs such as oxycodone/acetaminophen (eg, Percocet).	0
@phenotype$ were coded using @coding_system$ codes and subsequently aggregated into clinically meaningful categories.  	0

Because the location and nature of pain are not discernable from these scores, and back pain is the most common location associated with increased risk, 11 we classified each patient as @phenotype$ based on @coding_system$ diagnosis codes and treatments (epidural steroid injections in the neck or back) or imaging codes (magnetic resonance imaging scans of the spine) over the 2-year period before admission (Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AAP/A258 ).  	0
For each patient, we extracted data on characteristics shown to be associated @phenotype$ from various CDW domains, 7 , 11 , 14 including age, sex, race, body mass index, and preoperative diagnoses (categories using a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index based on @coding_system$ codes; Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AAP/A258 ).	0
15 Perhaps because of the lack of financial incentive to code for @phenotype$ within the VA system, these @coding_system$ codes were not well captured.	0
To circumvent this lack of accurate @coding_system$ coding for @phenotype$, we also extracted data from inpatient pharmacy and order set domains (showing that local anesthetic infusions had been ordered and dispensed during hospitalization).	0

We used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Clinical Classifications Software, with minor modifications, to map @coding_system$ codes uniquely to ten specific MHCs: @phenotype$.	0
A patient was considered “MHC Yes” if he/she had at least one instance of an @phenotype$ @coding_system$ code in the two years pre-OI, plus a confirmatory code during the OI.	0
Patients with @phenotype$ @coding_system$ in the three-year period were “MHC No.”	0
All others (i.e., those with an @phenotype$ @coding_system$ code in the two years pre-OI or during the one year OI, but not both) were “MHC Indeterminate” and were excluded.	0
For example, a patient was considered to have “depressive disorder Yes” if he/she had at least one instance of a @phenotype$ @coding_system$ code at baseline and at least one confirmatory code during the OI (versus no instance of depressive disorder in the three-year period).	0
